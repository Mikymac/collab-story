Once there was a
 cat called Marmalade,
That belonged to a man named Kevin,
It was an orange moggy,
Associated with visions of heaven.

Imagine a cat on one shoulder,
Jar of marmalade on the other,
It's bound to make you tingle,
Something you want to smother

When you see this man called Kevin,
Naked inside your head,
You'll drown yourself in love,
For a preserve to leave you dead.
