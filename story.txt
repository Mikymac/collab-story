Once there was a Large dude called kevin... a
frog, who sat happily upon a log. 
He counted to ten, then started again,
Because he was programmed in Prolog.
Once there was a bee called Tom,
who wanted a tree
sadly, they were a twat
but sometimes it just be like that
Once there was a man called fred,
He had a very big head,
he didnt like bread,
and now he is dead
Once there was a unicorn called Ben.
He loved to show off his horn.
